//In this lecture, we will learn about inheritance.

/*
# What is Inheritance?
- Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (called the child or subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (called the parent or superclass).

# Why Use Inheritance?

- Code Reusability

- Method Overriding

- Runtime Polymorphism

- Easier code maintenance and scalability
*/

class Parent {
    // fields and methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // additional fields and methods
}

// # Keyword 'extends' is used for inheritance.
/*
# Types of Inheritance in Java

Java supports the following types:

1. Single Inheritance

2. Multilevel Inheritance

3. Hierarchical Inheritance

- Java does NOT support Multiple Inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity.
- But it supports Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces.
