# What is Sorting?
- Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular format (usually ascending or descending).

Used in:

- Searching algorithms

- Data analysis

- Displaying data in ordered form

- Optimizing database queries

#Types of Sorting
- Internal Sorting: All data is loaded into memory (e.g., Arrays).

- External Sorting: Used for large data that doesnâ€™t fit in memory (e.g., files).

#Criteria:
- Time Complexity

- Space Complexity

- Stability (does it preserve the order of equal elements?)

- Adaptability (does it perform better on partially sorted data?)
