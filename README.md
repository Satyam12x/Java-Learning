## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Satyam12x/Java-Learning.git
cd Java-Learning


### 2. Set Up Your Environment

 Install **Java JDK 8** or later
* (Optional) Use an IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code + Java extensions

### 3. Compile and Run

From terminal:

cd Lesson1_HelloWorld
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld


Or import the folder into your IDE and run `.java` files directly.

### 4. Work Through Lessons in Order

Start with Lesson 1, then progress sequentially. After running each example, try modifying the code and completing the exercises.

## 🎯 How to Get the Most Out of This

1. **Follow sequence** — lessons build on previous ones
2. **Read comments** — they explain *why*, not just *how*
3. **Practice exercises** — change the code & test variations
4. **Use Git** — commit your changes frequently
5. **Explore issues/discussions** — ask questions & help others
6. **Create mini-projects** — e.g. calculator app, simple games
