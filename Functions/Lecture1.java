/*
Functions: Fucntion is a block of code which performs specific task.
- In Java, functions are called methods. A method is a block of code designed to perform a specific task and is associated with a class or an object.
* Methods help in:
- Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.
- Modularity: Break down complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces.
- Abstraction: Hide implementation details and expose only functionality.
- Methods can return a value or perform an action without returning anything (void).
